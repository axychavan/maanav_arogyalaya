                    <h4>A Unique Way of Teaching</h4>
                    <span>
                        Madhusudanji has a few specific points that he likes to focus on while teaching his class -

                        <dt>Proper Exercise – Asana</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Proper exercise acts as a method to make sure that all your muscles, joints, ligaments and
                            tendons are flexible and have enough blood circulation.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Proper Breathing – Pranayama</dt>
                        <dd>
                            This helps the body in becoming connected to its solar plexus, which is the core of the
                            body. This also helps to increase your clarity and vitality.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Proper Relaxation – Savasana</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Relaxation helps to give the body a reprieve and prevents it from becoming over-worked.
                            Relaxation is necessary to have a healthy, functioning body.

                        <dt>Proper Diet – Ayurvedic diet</dt>
                        <dd>
                            This helps our body get all nutrients, including sunlight and oxygen. All nutrients and fuel
                            for our bodies are equally necessary for maintaining a healthy body.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Proper Thinking and Meditation – Vedanta and Dhyana</dt>
                        <dd>
                            This helps you to put your mind in the correct place. This helps to settle your thoughts and
                            lets you and your mind have a slight reprieve.
