                        By joining this online yog class I have experienced a lot of benifits. My back pain is lessened.
                        The instructions given by the yog teacher is very clear and understandable. Acharyaji also
                        shares his knowledge of ayurveda along with teaching yogasanas. The arrangement of the class is
                        very good and easy.

                        Guruji, your online yog class is very good. In your classes, I learnt about yogasanas,
                        naturopathy, accupressure and how various diseases can be cured with the help of them and you
                        explain about it in detail. I had a severe knee pain which is now recovering well after
                        attending your yog classes daily. I have discovered a keen interest in yoga and there are lots
                        of things that can be learned.
