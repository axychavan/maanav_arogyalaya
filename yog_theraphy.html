            <p>
                Medical Yoga Therapy uses the practice of yoga for treating and preventing various medical conditions.
                This yoga therapy not only focuses on strengthening the body but it also incorporates appropriate
                breathing techniques, mindfulness, and meditation to help the individuals attain maximum benefits.
                Additionally, it helps in developing positive feelings and increases mental energy, while overcoming
                negative and aggressive feelings associated to depression and anxiety.

                Medical Yoga Therapy aims to help the patients in healing from within for a range of medical conditions.
                At Maanav Arogyalaya, Certified Yoga Therapist Madhusudan Nade is set to cure a range of low to moderate
                levels of
                physiological, anatomical, and psychological medical conditions. These include a range of back pain
                problems and spine deformities issues (such as lower back pain, sciatica, varicose veins, tilted pelvic,
                posture correction, etc), knee pain problems, lifestyle diseases, diabetes, hypertension, arthritis,
                obesity, thyroid, hormonal imbalance issues (such as PCOD, PCOS, etc), mental health issues, digestive
                problems, and gynecological or pregnancy related issues. The therapy has a holistic approach where the
                patient's problems are thoroughly understood and on the basis of that, Madhusudanji provides
                consultation, lifestyle changes, and specific ailment-related dietary suggestions. With this, he aims
                to help patients not only recover from the ailments physically but even mentally.

                Madhusudan Nade plays an active and thorough role in her patient's journey of healing through her 3-Week
                Medical Yoga Therapy sessions, and is determined to bring a healthy and positive change one patient at a
                time.
