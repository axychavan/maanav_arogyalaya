                                Madhusudhanji, your yog class is excellent. In addition to yog, you also teach about
                                naturopathy and acupressure and how they can be used to treat many diseases. I have
                                experienced great relief in my knee pain after attending your online yog classes. I
                                still have much to learn about yoga and look forward to continuing my education with
                                you.

                                Acharyaji's teachings on yog not only contribute significantly to improving health but
                                also promote overall human development. Yog allows us for the efficient execution of
                                daily tasks with skillfulness. It is an invaluable gift of Indian culture to the world,
                                which contributes to the betterment of humanity. The message of unity is spread through
                                yog. For all of these achievements, Madhusudanji and Yog Guru Swami Ramdev are
                                respectfully dedicated to providing knowledge of yog through a disciplined approach that
                                benefits everyone. Thank you.

                                positive impact on both my mental and physical well-being. Through this class,
                                Madhusudanji has taught me a variety of yoga asanas and body detoxification methods that
                                I continue to practice to this day. I am grateful to have learned from him and to have
