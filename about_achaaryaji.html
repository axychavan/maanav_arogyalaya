                    <h6>Proper Exercise – Asana</h6>
                    <p>
                        Proper exercise acts as a method to make sure that all your muscles, joints,
                        ligaments
                        and
                        tendons are flexible and have enough blood circulation.

                    <p>
                        This helps the body in becoming connected to its solar plexus, which is the core
                        of the
                        body. This also helps to increase your clarity and vitality.

                    <h6>Proper Relaxation – Shavasana</h6>
                    <p>
                        Relaxation helps to give the body a reprieve and prevents it from becoming
                        over-worked.
