                    <h3>What is Yoga ?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Yoga is a practice that originated in ancient India and has been around for thousands of
                        years. It involves
                        physical postures, breathing techniques, meditation, and ethical principles aimed at
                        improving physical,
                        mental, and spiritual health. Yoga has many different styles and practices, including Hatha,
                        Ashtanga,
                        Vinyasa, Kundalini, and Restorative yoga, among others. Some benefits of practicing yoga can

                        improved flexibility, strength, balance, stress reduction, and overall well-being. It's
                        important to learn
                        from a qualified teacher and to listen to your body to avoid injury and get the most out of
                        your practice.

                    <h3>What is Pranayama ?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Pranayama is a Sanskrit word that refers to the practice of controlling one's breath in
                        yoga. It involves
                        various breathing techniques that are designed to calm the mind, increase energy, and
                        improve overall health
                        and well-being. Pranayama can involve different types of breathing patterns, such as deep
                        and slow
                        breathing, rapid breathing, and alternate nostril breathing, among others. It's often
                        practiced in
                        conjunction with physical postures and meditation as part of a comprehensive yoga practice.
                        Pranayama is
                        believed to help regulate the flow of prana or life force energy in the body, and can have a
                        positive impact
                        on the respiratory, cardiovascular, and nervous systems.

                    <h3>What is Meditation ?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Meditation is a practice that involves training the mind to focus and calm the thoughts,
                        emotions, and
                        sensory experiences. It has been practiced for thousands of years and is a part of many
                        spiritual and
                        religious traditions, but can also be practiced in a secular context. Meditation can involve
                        various
                        techniques, such as mindfulness, visualization, and mantra repetition. It is typically done
                        in a quiet and
                        comfortable space, with the practitioner sitting or lying down and paying attention to the
                        breath or other
                        focal points. Some of the benefits of meditation can include reduced stress and anxiety,
                        improved focus and
                        concentration, increased self-awareness, and greater emotional well-being. Meditation is
                        considered a
                        powerful tool for promoting overall health and well-being, and can be practiced by anyone
                        regardless of age
                        or background.
